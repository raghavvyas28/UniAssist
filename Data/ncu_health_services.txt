The university provides on-campus medical facilities through a dedicated Medical Health Center. Two qualified doctors are available on rotation and provide both allopathic and homeopathic treatment. The health center is equipped with examination beds, essential medical equipment, and medicines to handle medical emergencies and first-aid situations such as injuries and accidents.

In case of serious medical conditions, the university operates a well-equipped ambulance van for evacuation to nearby Columbia Hospital. In addition to medical services, the center also has a Psychologist-cum-Counsellor available to assist students with personal, emotional, and mental health concerns.
