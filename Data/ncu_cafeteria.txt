The university provides a modern self-service cafeteria where students and staff can select meals from an open-counter display. The cafeteria is designed to accommodate large numbers efficiently and offers healthy and nutritious food options. It also serves as a social space for students between classes.

A designated Lunch Club area is available for faculty and staff. The campus has three canteens: Cafe 1 located on the first floor of the new building, Cafe 10 near the ground area, and Nescafe near the basketball and volleyball courts.
